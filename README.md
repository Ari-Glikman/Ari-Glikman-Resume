________________


### Purpose

Why would you want to create a resume with markdown and host it on GitHub in the first place? 

For starters, markdown is one of the most popular lightweight markup languages, since it is easy to learn and converts to HTML quickly. Learning to use it will be useful as it is used everywhere on the internet!             
Secondly, static websites, as Andrew Etter will tell you, are everywhere and anywhere. On top of that, they are easy, secure, fast, and portable. By hosting your resume on GitHub pages you will be utilizing one yourself.

Lastly, having your resume online is a no-brainer if you are in tech. As a bonus GitHub pages will also give you a nice URL, which will look impressive and allow yourself to look like the polished person you are.

### Pre-requisites

1. Some Markdown Know-how
    * You can learn quickly [here.](#more-Resources)

3. A GitHub account

### Instructions

The steps will be simple easy to follow.

### 1. Create a new repository on GitHub (and make sure it is public)

All the material that you will need will exist within a single repository on GitHub. You can go ahead and create one by cliking the '+' at the top right corner of your GitHub page and select 'New repository'. 

![Newrepository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73805987/97831667-5912ab80-1c96-11eb-9281-6dd94da0854d.jpg)

Next you will want to create a name and a description as well. Here you should again take into account the purpose of technical communication as worder perfectly by Etter "Write down exactly what an audience needs to know and *no more*". Scroll down and ensure that it is public (if it's not you will not be able to host it on GitHub pages under a unique URL). 

Your page should look something like this:

![PublicRepository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73805987/97832248-eb677f00-1c97-11eb-8e30-7b098472819c.png)

It will be simpler for you if you **do not** initialize your repository with anything for now. Unless you are experienced and know that doing otherwise will be best for you then go ahead.

Go ahead and click 'Create repository'.



### 2. Enable GitHub Pages 

Remember the static websites that are so handy? We are going to go ahead and use it now. Though there are many to choose from, the one you are going to use today is Jekyll. Don't worry: you do not have to know what Jekyll is or how to use it, but just know that you will use it as your static site generator.
